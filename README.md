# Gomi Technology ComputerVision
1. __Only code, and models__ will be posted in the __projects__ folder, please __do not__ upload photos, or large datasets, post the large datasets and/or photos in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lCilxi2755K4VveZBEgEYJi9q69KlFHF?usp=sharing). If model files become too large, I will set up a Google Drive to dump the models.

2. __All the required images/photos/datasets__ will be accessible through [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lCilxi2755K4VveZBEgEYJi9q69KlFHF?usp=sharing). Feel free to add/download files that you think are going to be helpful.

3. __Please read__ [the Coding Style document](codingStyle.md) before commiting any code to the repo.

4. To configure your Ubuntu environment for deep learning with Python
   * refer to [this](https://github.com/gomi-tech/ComputerVision/blob/master/ubuntu-cpu-setup/linuxConfigCPU.md) document if you don't have a GPU that is listed [here](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/cuda/supported-gpus?field_gpu_type_value=All) , (CPU version of TensorFlow)
   * refer to [this](https://github.com/gomi-tech/ComputerVision/blob/master/ubuntu-gpu-setup/linuxConfigGPU.md) doucment if you have a GPU that is listed [here]([here](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/cuda/supported-gpus?field_gpu_type_value=All)), (GPU version of TensorFlow + CUDA)
